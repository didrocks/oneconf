oneconf (0.2.1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New release:
    - get the toolbar hiding when in detail view. Thanks Gary Lasker
    - compute an update the first time if current host list necessary
      and no update done
    - add translation support and generate template
    - provide the ONECONF_HOST environment variable to define a fake
      hostid and hostname for testing purpose
    - enable remotely to set some pending state for other hosts,
      like hide inventory. The effect isn't immediate and is queued in
      a pending file until next connexion to the server. Add some
      safeguards for corner cases
